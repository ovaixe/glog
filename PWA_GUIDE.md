## 🚀 Building for Production

To build the PWA for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The service worker will be generated automatically during the build process.

## 🔧 PWA Configuration

The PWA is configured with:

- **Service Worker**: Auto-generated by next-pwa
- **Offline Fallback**: Custom offline page
- **Caching Strategy**: Network-first with fallback
- **Icons**: 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons
- **Theme Color**: #4a9eff (Primary blue)
- **Background Color**: #1a1f2e (Dark navy)

## 📝 Development Notes

- Service worker is **disabled in development mode** for easier debugging
- Generated files (`sw.js`, `workbox-*.js`) are in `.gitignore`
- Icons are stored in `/public` directory
- Manifest file: `/public/manifest.json`

## 🎨 Customization

To customize the PWA:

1. **Icons**: Replace `/public/icon-192x192.png` and `/public/icon-512x512.png`
2. **Manifest**: Edit `/public/manifest.json`
3. **Theme Colors**: Update in `app/layout.tsx` metadata
4. **Offline Page**: Customize `/public/offline.html`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**App not installing?**

- Make sure you're using HTTPS (or localhost)
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Check that manifest.json is accessible

**Service worker not updating?**

- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Unregister old service workers in DevTools
- Clear site data and reinstall

**Offline mode not working?**

- Build the production version first
- Service worker only works in production mode
- Check browser console for errors
